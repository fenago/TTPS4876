# Appendix 2: Building a Flight Delay Prediction System

## Why This Matters to You

**🎯 The Real Problem:** Every day, thousands of flights are delayed, costing airlines billions and frustrating millions of passengers. But what if you could predict these delays before they happen?

**💡 Your Challenge:** Build a machine learning system that can warn airlines about potential delays, giving them time to take action.

**🔬 What You'll Learn:**
- How to tackle messy, real-world data
- When flights are most likely to be delayed (and why)
- How to build classifiers that work with imbalanced data
- How to turn predictions into business value

**🥚 Easter Egg #1:** The world's first flight delay was probably in 1903 when the Wright Brothers had to wait for better weather conditions! ✈️

---

## Step 1: Understanding What Makes Flights Delay

### 1.1 Let's Look at Real Flight Data

Before jumping into code, let's understand what we're working with.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the flight data
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fenago/datasets/refs/heads/main/FlightDelays.csv"
flights = pd.read_csv(url)

print(f"📊 We have {len(flights):,} flight records to analyze")
print(f"📋 Columns available: {list(flights.columns)}")
```

**🤔 Stop and Think:** Before running any complex analysis, what factors do YOU think cause flight delays?

- Weather conditions?
- Time of day?
- Airline efficiency?
- Airport congestion?
- Day of the week?

Let's find out if your intuition is correct!

### 1.2 Exploring One Thing at a Time

**💡 Learning Principle:** Don't try to understand everything at once. Pick one column and really understand it.

```python
# First, let's just look at one simple thing - what columns do we have?
print("🔍 Let's examine our data step by step:")
print(flights.info())
```

**📝 Your Turn:** Run this code and answer these questions:
1. How many rows and columns do we have?
2. Are there any missing values?
3. What data types do we see?

**💡 Key Insight:** Real data is messy. Always start by understanding what you have before trying to build models.

### 1.3 Finding the "Delay" Information

```python
# Let's find columns that might tell us about delays
delay_columns = [col for col in flights.columns if 'delay' in col.lower()]
print(f"🕐 Delay-related columns: {delay_columns}")

# Look at a few sample rows
print("\n📄 Sample of our data:")
print(flights.head(3))
```

**🎯 Your Mission:** Look at the output and identify:
1. Which column tells us if a flight was delayed?
2. What does the delay information look like?
3. Do you see any patterns just from these few rows?

**🤔 Think About It:** If you were an airline manager, what would YOU consider a "meaningful" delay? 5 minutes? 15 minutes? 30 minutes?

---

## Step 2: Creating Your Target Variable

### 2.1 Defining "Delayed" for Business

**💼 Business Decision:** The airline industry considers a flight "on-time" if it arrives within 15 minutes of schedule. Let's use this standard.

```python
# Let's see what delay data we actually have
if 'ArrDelay' in flights.columns:
    print("✅ We have arrival delay data in minutes")
    print(f"Delay range: {flights['ArrDelay'].min():.0f} to {flights['ArrDelay'].max():.0f} minutes")
    
    # Quick check - what does the delay distribution look like?
    print(f"Average delay: {flights['ArrDelay'].mean():.1f} minutes")
    print(f"Flights with no delay (≤0 min): {(flights['ArrDelay'] <= 0).sum():,}")
    print(f"Flights with some delay (>0 min): {(flights['ArrDelay'] > 0).sum():,}")
```

**📊 Let's Visualize This:**

```python
# Simple histogram to understand delays
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 4))

plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
# Only plot reasonable delays (not extreme outliers)
reasonable_delays = flights[(flights['ArrDelay'] >= -30) & (flights['ArrDelay'] <= 120)]
plt.hist(reasonable_delays['ArrDelay'], bins=30, alpha=0.7, color='steelblue')
plt.xlabel('Delay Minutes')
plt.ylabel('Number of Flights')
plt.title('Distribution of Flight Delays')
plt.axvline(x=15, color='red', linestyle='--', label='15-min threshold')
plt.legend()

plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
# Simple pie chart of on-time vs delayed
delayed_count = (flights['ArrDelay'] > 15).sum()
ontime_count = len(flights) - delayed_count
plt.pie([ontime_count, delayed_count], labels=['On-Time', 'Delayed'], autopct='%1.1f%%')
plt.title('On-Time vs Delayed Flights')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

**🎯 Now Create the Target Variable:**

```python
# Create our prediction target
flights['is_delayed'] = (flights['ArrDelay'] > 15).astype(int)

delay_rate = flights['is_delayed'].mean()
print(f"📊 {delay_rate:.1%} of flights are delayed (>15 minutes)")
print(f"✅ Created target variable: 'is_delayed'")
```

**💡 Stop and Reflect:** 
- Are you surprised by the delay rate?
- Do you think 15 minutes is a good threshold?
- What would happen if we used 30 minutes instead?

**📝 Quick Experiment:** Try changing the threshold to 30 minutes and see how the delay rate changes:

```python
# Try this yourself:
# flights['is_delayed_30'] = (flights['ArrDelay'] > 30).astype(int)
# print(f"Delay rate with 30-min threshold: {flights['is_delayed_30'].mean():.1%}")
```

---

## Step 3: Understanding Time Patterns (The Key to Airline Delays)

### 3.1 Why Time Matters Most

**🕐 Big Insight:** Flight delays aren't random. They follow patterns based on:
- Time of day (rush hours)
- Day of week (business vs leisure travel)
- Season (weather, holidays)

**🥚 Easter Egg #2:** Airlines schedule more flights during "banker's hours" because business travelers pay higher fares! 💼

Let's discover these patterns step by step.

### 3.2 Time of Day Patterns

First, let's extract the hour from departure time:

```python
# Convert departure time to hour (assuming it's in HHMM format)
flights['dep_hour'] = (flights['CRSDepTime'] // 100)

print("🕐 Departure hours in our data:")
print(f"Range: {flights['dep_hour'].min()} to {flights['dep_hour'].max()}")
print(f"Sample times: {flights['dep_hour'].head(10).tolist()}")
```

**💡 Understanding Check:** Look at the sample times. Do they make sense as hours of the day?

Now let's see when delays happen most:

```python
# Calculate delay rate by hour
hourly_delays = flights.groupby('dep_hour')['is_delayed'].mean()

print("📈 Delay rates by departure hour:")
for hour in sorted(hourly_delays.index):
    rate = hourly_delays[hour]
    print(f"{hour:2d}:00 - {rate:.1%}")
```

**🤔 Your Analysis:** Look at this data and answer:
1. What time has the highest delay rate?
2. What time has the lowest delay rate?
3. Can you explain why this pattern makes sense?

**📊 Visualize the Pattern:**

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
hourly_delays.plot(kind='bar', color='lightcoral', alpha=0.7)
plt.title('Flight Delay Rate by Hour of Day')
plt.xlabel('Hour of Day')
plt.ylabel('Delay Rate')
plt.xticks(rotation=0)
plt.show()

# Find peak delay hour
peak_hour = hourly_delays.idxmax()
peak_rate = hourly_delays.max()
print(f"🔴 Peak delay time: {peak_hour}:00 ({peak_rate:.1%} delay rate)")
```

**💡 Business Insight:** Airlines can use this information to:
- Schedule more buffer time for flights during peak delay hours
- Adjust pricing based on delay risk
- Manage passenger expectations

### 3.3 Creating Time-Based Features

Now let's turn these insights into features our model can use:

```python
# Create time-based features based on what we learned

# Rush hour periods (when delays are highest)
flights['is_morning_rush'] = flights['dep_hour'].isin([7, 8, 9]).astype(int)
flights['is_evening_rush'] = flights['dep_hour'].isin([17, 18, 19]).astype(int)

# Early morning flights (usually more reliable)
flights['is_early_morning'] = (flights['dep_hour'] < 7).astype(int)

# Late night flights
flights['is_late_night'] = (flights['dep_hour'] >= 22).astype(int)

print("✅ Created time-based features:")
print(f"Morning rush flights: {flights['is_morning_rush'].sum():,}")
print(f"Evening rush flights: {flights['is_evening_rush'].sum():,}")
print(f"Early morning flights: {flights['is_early_morning'].sum():,}")
print(f"Late night flights: {flights['is_late_night'].sum():,}")
```

**📝 Test Your Understanding:** Which of these flight types do you think has the lowest delay rate? Make a prediction, then test it:

```python
# Test your prediction:
print("🧪 Delay rates by flight type:")
print(f"Morning rush: {flights[flights['is_morning_rush']==1]['is_delayed'].mean():.1%}")
print(f"Evening rush: {flights[flights['is_evening_rush']==1]['is_delayed'].mean():.1%}")
print(f"Early morning: {flights[flights['is_early_morning']==1]['is_delayed'].mean():.1%}")
print(f"Late night: {flights[flights['is_late_night']==1]['is_delayed'].mean():.1%}")
```

**🎯 Were you right?** Understanding these patterns is exactly how machine learning works - finding patterns in data!

---

## Step 4: Building Your First Flight Delay Classifier

### 4.1 Preparing the Data

**💡 Key Concept:** Machine learning models need clean, numerical data. Let's prepare our data step by step.

```python
# Select features for our first simple model
features_to_use = [
    'dep_hour',
    'is_morning_rush', 
    'is_evening_rush',
    'is_early_morning',
    'is_late_night'
]

print("🎯 Building model with these features:")
for i, feature in enumerate(features_to_use, 1):
    print(f"{i}. {feature}")
```

**🤔 Think About It:** We're starting simple. Why not use ALL available features right away?

**💡 Answer:** Start simple, then add complexity. This helps you understand what's working and why.

```python
# Prepare the data
X = flights[features_to_use].copy()
y = flights['is_delayed'].copy()

# Check for any missing values
print(f"\n🔍 Data quality check:")
print(f"Features shape: {X.shape}")
print(f"Target shape: {y.shape}")
print(f"Missing values: {X.isnull().sum().sum()}")
print(f"Target distribution: {y.value_counts().to_dict()}")
```

### 4.2 The Train/Test Split Concept

**💡 Critical Concept:** We need to test our model on data it has never seen before.

**🤔 Why?** Imagine studying for a test using the exact same questions that will be on the test. You might memorize the answers, but do you really understand the material?

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Split the data: 80% for training, 20% for testing
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=y
)

print("📚 Data split complete:")
print(f"Training data: {len(X_train):,} flights")
print(f"Testing data: {len(X_test):,} flights")

# Check if the split maintained the same delay rate
print(f"Training delay rate: {y_train.mean():.1%}")
print(f"Testing delay rate: {y_test.mean():.1%}")
```

**✅ Good Practice:** The delay rates should be similar in both training and test sets.

### 4.3 Your First Prediction Model

**🎯 The Moment of Truth:** Let's build a model that predicts flight delays!

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Create and train the model
print("🤖 Training your flight delay prediction model...")

model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=50, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

print("✅ Model training complete!")

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Calculate accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print(f"🎯 Model accuracy: {accuracy:.1%}")
```

**🤔 Interpretation:** 
- If your accuracy is around 70-80%, that's actually quite good for this problem!
- Why? Because flight delays depend on many factors we haven't included yet (weather, mechanical issues, air traffic control)

### 4.4 Understanding What Your Model Learned

```python
# See which features matter most
feature_importance = model.feature_importances_

print("📊 What your model learned (feature importance):")
for feature, importance in zip(features_to_use, feature_importance):
    print(f"{feature}: {importance:.3f}")
    
# Find the most important feature
most_important = features_to_use[np.argmax(feature_importance)]
print(f"\n🏆 Most important feature: {most_important}")
```

**💡 Business Insight:** The most important feature tells you what airlines should focus on first when trying to reduce delays.

### 4.5 Testing Individual Predictions

Let's see how your model predicts specific flights:

```python
# Test some specific flight scenarios
test_flights = [
    [6, 0, 0, 1, 0],   # 6 AM, early morning flight
    [8, 1, 0, 0, 0],   # 8 AM, morning rush
    [18, 0, 1, 0, 0],  # 6 PM, evening rush  
    [23, 0, 0, 0, 1]   # 11 PM, late night
]

flight_descriptions = [
    "6 AM Early Morning Flight",
    "8 AM Morning Rush Flight", 
    "6 PM Evening Rush Flight",
    "11 PM Late Night Flight"
]

print("🔮 Testing specific flight scenarios:")

for flight_data, description in zip(test_flights, flight_descriptions):
    prediction = model.predict([flight_data])[0]
    probability = model.predict_proba([flight_data])[0][1]
    
    result = "DELAYED" if prediction else "ON-TIME"
    print(f"{description}: {result} (probability: {probability:.1%})")
```

**📝 Your Analysis:** 
- Which flight type has the highest delay probability?
- Does this match what you found in the data exploration?
- Are you surprised by any predictions?

---

## Step 5: Making Your Model Better

### 5.1 Adding More Features

**💡 Next Level:** Let's add more sophisticated features to improve predictions.

**🤔 What else might predict delays?**
- Day of week (business vs weekend travel)
- Airline (some are more reliable)
- Distance (longer flights have more complexity)

Let's add these step by step:

```python
# Add day of week features (if we have date information)
if 'DayOfWeek' in flights.columns:
    flights['is_weekend'] = (flights['DayOfWeek'] >= 6).astype(int)
    flights['is_monday'] = (flights['DayOfWeek'] == 1).astype(int)
    flights['is_friday'] = (flights['DayOfWeek'] == 5).astype(int)
    
    print("✅ Added day-of-week features")
else:
    print("ℹ️ No day-of-week data available")

# Add airline features (if we have carrier information)
if 'UniqueCarrier' in flights.columns:
    # Calculate each airline's delay rate
    airline_delay_rates = flights.groupby('UniqueCarrier')['is_delayed'].mean()
    flights['airline_delay_rate'] = flights['UniqueCarrier'].map(airline_delay_rates)
    
    print("✅ Added airline performance feature")
    print("Top 5 most reliable airlines:")
    top_airlines = airline_delay_rates.sort_values().head()
    for airline, rate in top_airlines.items():
        print(f"  {airline}: {rate:.1%} delay rate")
else:
    print("ℹ️ No airline data available")

# Add distance features (if available)
if 'Distance' in flights.columns:
    flights['is_short_flight'] = (flights['Distance'] < 500).astype(int)
    flights['is_long_flight'] = (flights['Distance'] > 1500).astype(int)
    
    print("✅ Added distance features")
else:
    print("ℹ️ No distance data available")
```

### 5.2 Building an Improved Model

```python
# Create an enhanced feature set
enhanced_features = [
    'dep_hour',
    'is_morning_rush', 
    'is_evening_rush',
    'is_early_morning',
    'is_late_night'
]

# Add available new features
additional_features = []
for feature in ['is_weekend', 'is_monday', 'is_friday', 'airline_delay_rate', 'is_short_flight', 'is_long_flight']:
    if feature in flights.columns:
        additional_features.append(feature)

all_features = enhanced_features + additional_features

print(f"🚀 Enhanced model will use {len(all_features)} features:")
for i, feature in enumerate(all_features, 1):
    print(f"  {i}. {feature}")
```

**📝 Your Prediction:** Do you think the enhanced model will be more accurate? Why or why not?

```python
# Train the enhanced model
X_enhanced = flights[all_features].fillna(0)  # Fill any missing values
y_enhanced = flights['is_delayed']

X_train_enh, X_test_enh, y_train_enh, y_test_enh = train_test_split(
    X_enhanced, y_enhanced, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=y_enhanced
)

# Train enhanced model
enhanced_model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
enhanced_model.fit(X_train_enh, y_train_enh)

# Compare performance
simple_accuracy = accuracy
enhanced_predictions = enhanced_model.predict(X_test_enh)
enhanced_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test_enh, enhanced_predictions)

print("📊 Model Comparison:")
print(f"Simple model accuracy:   {simple_accuracy:.1%}")
print(f"Enhanced model accuracy: {enhanced_accuracy:.1%}")
print(f"Improvement: {enhanced_accuracy - simple_accuracy:.1%}")
```

**🎉 Results Analysis:**
- Did the enhanced model perform better?
- If yes, why do you think that happened?
- If no, what might be the reasons?

---

## Step 6: Understanding Model Performance

### 6.1 Beyond Accuracy - What Really Matters

**💡 Critical Insight:** Accuracy isn't everything. In business, different types of errors have different costs.

**🤔 Think About It:**
- **False Positive:** Model predicts delay, but flight is on-time
  - Cost: Unnecessary preparation, passenger anxiety
- **False Negative:** Model predicts on-time, but flight is delayed  
  - Cost: No preparation, angry passengers, compensation costs

Which is worse for an airline?

```python
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, classification_report

# Analyze detailed performance
y_pred = enhanced_model.predict(X_test_enh)
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test_enh, y_pred)

print("🎯 Detailed Model Performance:")
print("Confusion Matrix:")
print("                Predicted")
print("              On-Time  Delayed")
print(f"Actual On-Time    {cm[0,0]:4d}    {cm[0,1]:4d}")
print(f"       Delayed    {cm[1,0]:4d}    {cm[1,1]:4d}")

# Calculate business-relevant metrics
true_negatives, false_positives, false_negatives, true_positives = cm.ravel()

print(f"\n💼 Business Translation:")
print(f"✅ Correctly predicted on-time flights: {true_negatives:,}")
print(f"✅ Correctly predicted delays: {true_positives:,}")
print(f"❌ False alarms (predicted delay, was on-time): {false_positives:,}")
print(f"❌ Missed delays (predicted on-time, was delayed): {false_negatives:,}")

# Calculate rates
precision = true_positives / (true_positives + false_positives)
recall = true_positives / (true_positives + false_negatives)

print(f"\n📊 Key Metrics:")
print(f"Precision: {precision:.1%} (when we predict delay, we're right {precision:.1%} of the time)")
print(f"Recall: {recall:.1%} (we catch {recall:.1%} of actual delays)")
```

**💡 Business Decision:** Which metric matters more depends on the business context:
- **High Precision:** Minimize false alarms (don't waste resources)
- **High Recall:** Catch all delays (don't surprise passengers)

### 6.2 Feature Importance Deep Dive

```python
# Understand what drives predictions
feature_importance_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'feature': all_features,
    'importance': enhanced_model.feature_importances_
}).sort_values('importance', ascending=False)

print("🔍 What your model learned - Feature Importance:")
for idx, row in feature_importance_df.iterrows():
    print(f"{row['feature']}: {row['importance']:.3f}")

# Visualize top features
top_10_features = feature_importance_df.head(10)

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.barh(range(len(top_10_features)), top_10_features['importance'])
plt.yticks(range(len(top_10_features)), top_10_features['feature'])
plt.xlabel('Feature Importance')
plt.title('Top 10 Most Important Features for Delay Prediction')
plt.gca().invert_yaxis()  # Most important at top
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

most_important_feature = feature_importance_df.iloc[0]['feature']
print(f"\n🏆 Most important factor for delays: {most_important_feature}")
```

**💡 Actionable Insights:** Airlines can use this feature importance to:
1. Focus improvement efforts on the most impactful factors
2. Understand their operational weaknesses
3. Set pricing and scheduling strategies

---

## Step 7: Making Business Decisions

### 7.1 Turning Predictions into Action

**🎯 The Ultimate Goal:** Your model should help airlines make better decisions.

Let's create a simple decision framework:

```python
def make_delay_decision(probability, threshold=0.5):
    """
    Convert delay probability into business action.
    """
    if probability > 0.8:
        return "HIGH_RISK", "Alert passengers, prepare alternatives, review crew"
    elif probability > 0.6:
        return "MODERATE_RISK", "Monitor closely, have backup plans ready"
    elif probability > threshold:
        return "SOME_RISK", "Standard monitoring with slight caution"
    else:
        return "LOW_RISK", "Proceed normally"

# Test the decision framework
test_scenarios = [
    ("Early morning business flight", [6, 0, 0, 1, 0] + [0] * (len(all_features) - 5)),
    ("Friday evening rush", [18, 0, 1, 0, 0] + [1, 0, 1] + [0] * (len(all_features) - 8)),
    ("Weekend leisure flight", [14, 0, 0, 0, 0] + [1, 0, 0] + [0] * (len(all_features) - 8))
]

print("🎯 Business Decision Framework:")
print("=" * 50)

for scenario_name, scenario_data in test_scenarios:
    # Ensure we have the right number of features
    scenario_array = scenario_data[:len(all_features)]
    if len(scenario_array) < len(all_features):
        scenario_array.extend([0] * (len(all_features) - len(scenario_array)))
    
    probability = enhanced_model.predict_proba([scenario_array])[0][1]
    risk_level, action = make_delay_decision(probability)
    
    print(f"\n✈️ {scenario_name}:")
    print(f"   Delay probability: {probability:.1%}")
    print(f"   Risk level: {risk_level}")
    print(f"   Recommended action: {action}")
```

### 7.2 Cost-Benefit Analysis

**💰 The Bottom Line:** Does this model save money?

```python
# Simple cost-benefit calculation
def calculate_business_value(true_positives, false_positives, false_negatives, true_negatives):
    """
    Calculate the business value of the prediction model.
    """
    
    # Cost assumptions (these would come from airline data)
    cost_per_unplanned_delay = 1500  # Emergency rebooking, compensation, etc.
    cost_per_false_alarm = 200       # Unnecessary preparation costs
    cost_saved_per_predicted_delay = 800  # Proactive management savings
    
    # Calculate costs and savings
    delay_prevention_savings = true_positives * cost_saved_per_predicted_delay
    false_alarm_costs = false_positives * cost_per_false_alarm
    missed_delay_costs = false_negatives * cost_per_unplanned_delay
    
    net_savings = delay_prevention_savings - false_alarm_costs - missed_delay_costs
    
    return {
        'savings': delay_prevention_savings,
        'false_alarm_costs': false_alarm_costs,
        'missed_delay_costs': missed_delay_costs,
        'net_savings': net_savings
    }

# Calculate for our model
business_value = calculate_business_value(true_positives, false_positives, false_negatives, true_negatives)

print("💰 Business Value Analysis:")
print(f"Delay prevention savings: ${business_value['savings']:,}")
print(f"False alarm costs: ${business_value['false_alarm_costs']:,}")
print(f"Missed delay costs: ${business_value['missed_delay_costs']:,}")
print(f"Net savings: ${business_value['net_savings']:,}")

if business_value['net_savings'] > 0:
    print("✅ The model creates positive business value!")
else:
    print("❌ The model needs improvement to be cost-effective")
```

**🤔 Your Analysis:** 
- Is the model profitable?
- What could you change to improve the business value?
- Which costs have the biggest impact?
