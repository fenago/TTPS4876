# Lab 11: Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn

## Lab Objectives

**üéØ IMPORTANT NOTE:** Machine Learning helps us predict future outcomes and find patterns too complex for traditional analysis. Instead of just describing what happened, we'll build models that predict what will happen. We'll focus on practical business applications using real data to solve actual problems.

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

1. **Understand when to use machine learning** - Recognize problems where prediction adds business value
2. **Build regression models** - Predict numerical outcomes like prices or revenue
3. **Create classification models** - Predict categories like success/failure or customer types
4. **Evaluate model performance** - Know if your predictions are reliable enough for business decisions
5. **Apply ML to business problems** - Use models to support strategic decisions

## üìö Machine Learning in Business Context

**ü§ñ What is Machine Learning Really?**
- **Traditional analysis**: "Manhattan properties cost more than Brooklyn" (descriptive)
- **Machine learning**: "This new property will likely cost $180 based on its features" (predictive)

**üíº Business Applications:**
- **Price prediction**: What should we charge for a new property?
- **Customer classification**: Which customers are likely to book premium properties?
- **Risk assessment**: Which properties are likely to have low occupancy?

**üéØ Our Approach:** Build simple, interpretable models that solve real business problems.

## Step 1: Understanding Machine Learning Problems

### 1.1 Types of Business Problems

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, accuracy_score, classification_report
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load our data
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fenago/datasets/refs/heads/main/AirBnB_NYC_2019.csv"
airbnb_df = pd.read_csv(url)

print(f"üè† Loaded {len(airbnb_df):,} properties for ML analysis")
```

**üéØ Two Main Problem Types:**

**1. Regression (Predicting Numbers):**
- "What price should we set for this property?"
- "How much revenue will this generate?"
- "What occupancy rate can we expect?"

**2. Classification (Predicting Categories):**
- "Will this property be successful (high bookings)?"
- "What type of customer will book this property?"
- "Is this property overpriced or underpriced?"

### 1.2 The ML Workflow

**üîÑ Standard Process:**
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Business Problem] --> B[Prepare Data]
    B --> C[Choose Model]
    C --> D[Train Model]
    D --> E[Evaluate Performance]
    E --> F[Make Predictions]
    F --> G[Business Decisions]
```

**üí° Key Insight:** ML is about finding patterns in existing data to make predictions about new situations.

---

## Step 2: Regression - Predicting Property Prices

### 2.1 Business Problem Setup

**üí∞ Business Question:** "Can we predict what a property should cost based on its characteristics?"

```python
# Prepare data for price prediction
# Select features that might influence price
features = ['neighbourhood_group', 'room_type', 'number_of_reviews', 
           'availability_365', 'calculated_host_listings_count']

# Clean the data
ml_data = airbnb_df[features + ['price']].copy()
ml_data = ml_data.dropna()

print(f"üìä ML Dataset: {len(ml_data):,} properties with complete data")
print(f"üìä Features: {features}")
```

### 2.2 Feature Engineering

**üîß Converting Text to Numbers:** ML models need numerical input.

```python
# Convert categorical variables to numbers
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

# Create copies for encoding
X = ml_data[features].copy()
y = ml_data['price'].copy()

# Encode categorical variables
le_neighborhood = LabelEncoder()
le_room_type = LabelEncoder()

X['neighbourhood_group'] = le_neighborhood.fit_transform(X['neighbourhood_group'])
X['room_type'] = le_room_type.fit_transform(X['room_type'])

print("üîß Feature Engineering Complete:")
print(f"Neighborhood encoding: {dict(zip(le_neighborhood.classes_, range(len(le_neighborhood.classes_))))}")
print(f"Room type encoding: {dict(zip(le_room_type.classes_, range(len(le_room_type.classes_))))}")
```

### 2.3 Building Your First Model

**üöÄ Training a Price Prediction Model:**

```python
# Split data: 80% for training, 20% for testing
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

print(f"üìö Training data: {len(X_train):,} properties")
print(f"üß™ Testing data: {len(X_test):,} properties")

# Create and train the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

print("‚úÖ Model trained successfully!")
```

### 2.4 Making Predictions

**üîÆ Testing Our Model:**

```python
# Make predictions on test data
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Compare predictions to actual prices
comparison_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Actual_Price': y_test,
    'Predicted_Price': predictions,
    'Difference': y_test - predictions
})

print("üîÆ Sample Predictions:")
print(comparison_df.head(10).round(2))

# Calculate accuracy
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)
rmse = np.sqrt(mse)

print(f"\nüìä Model Performance:")
print(f"Average prediction error: ${rmse:.2f}")
print(f"Average actual price: ${y_test.mean():.2f}")
print(f"Error as % of average price: {(rmse/y_test.mean())*100:.1f}%")
```

### 2.5 Understanding What Drives Prices

**üîç Feature Importance:**

```python
# See which features matter most
feature_importance = pd.DataFrame({
    'Feature': features,
    'Importance': abs(model.coef_)
})
feature_importance = feature_importance.sort_values('Importance', ascending=False)

print("üìà Feature Importance (What Affects Price Most):")
print(feature_importance)

# Visualize
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.barh(feature_importance['Feature'], feature_importance['Importance'])
plt.title('What Features Drive Property Prices?')
plt.xlabel('Importance')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

## Step 3: Classification - Predicting Success Categories

### 3.1 Defining Business Success

**üéØ Business Problem:** "Can we predict which properties will be successful (high demand)?"

```python
# Define success based on number of reviews (proxy for bookings)
review_threshold = ml_data['number_of_reviews'].quantile(0.75)  # Top 25%

ml_data['is_successful'] = (ml_data['number_of_reviews'] >= review_threshold).astype(int)

success_rate = ml_data['is_successful'].mean()
print(f"üéØ Success Definition: Properties with {review_threshold:.0f}+ reviews")
print(f"üéØ Success Rate: {success_rate:.1%} of properties are 'successful'")

# Check success by room type
success_by_type = ml_data.groupby('room_type')['is_successful'].mean()
print(f"\nüìä Success Rate by Room Type:")
for room_type, rate in success_by_type.items():
    print(f"{room_type}: {rate:.1%}")
```

### 3.2 Building a Classification Model

**üîÆ Predicting Property Success:**

```python
# Prepare features for classification
X_class = X.copy()  # Same features as before
y_class = ml_data['is_successful']

# Split the data
X_train_c, X_test_c, y_train_c, y_test_c = train_test_split(
    X_class, y_class, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
)

# Train a Random Forest classifier
clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
clf.fit(X_train_c, y_train_c)

print("‚úÖ Classification model trained!")

# Make predictions
pred_class = clf.predict(X_test_c)
pred_proba = clf.predict_proba(X_test_c)[:, 1]  # Probability of success

# Evaluate accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test_c, pred_class)
print(f"üéØ Model Accuracy: {accuracy:.1%}")
```

### 3.3 Understanding Prediction Confidence

**üìä Probability-Based Predictions:**

```python
# Create results dataframe
results_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Actual_Success': y_test_c,
    'Predicted_Success': pred_class,
    'Success_Probability': pred_proba
})

print("üîÆ Classification Results Sample:")
print(results_df.head(10).round(3))

# Analyze by confidence level
high_confidence = results_df[results_df['Success_Probability'] > 0.8]
low_confidence = results_df[results_df['Success_Probability'] < 0.2]

print(f"\nüìä Confidence Analysis:")
print(f"High confidence predictions (>80%): {len(high_confidence):,}")
print(f"Low confidence predictions (<20%): {len(low_confidence):,}")

# Accuracy by confidence level
if len(high_confidence) > 0:
    high_conf_accuracy = (high_confidence['Actual_Success'] == high_confidence['Predicted_Success']).mean()
    print(f"Accuracy on high confidence predictions: {high_conf_accuracy:.1%}")
```

## Step 4: Model Evaluation and Business Application

### 4.1 Understanding Model Reliability

**üìä Is Our Model Good Enough for Business Decisions?**

```python
# Create detailed evaluation
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix

# Confusion matrix for classification
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test_c, pred_class)

print("üéØ Classification Model Performance:")
print("Confusion Matrix:")
print("                Predicted")
print("              Fail  Success")
print(f"Actual Fail    {cm[0,0]:4d}    {cm[0,1]:4d}")
print(f"     Success   {cm[1,0]:4d}    {cm[1,1]:4d}")

# Business interpretation
true_positives = cm[1,1]  # Correctly predicted successes
false_positives = cm[0,1]  # Incorrectly predicted successes
false_negatives = cm[1,0]  # Missed successes

precision = true_positives / (true_positives + false_positives)
recall = true_positives / (true_positives + false_negatives)

print(f"\nüíº Business Metrics:")
print(f"Precision: {precision:.1%} (when we predict success, we're right {precision:.1%} of the time)")
print(f"Recall: {recall:.1%} (we catch {recall:.1%} of actual successes)")
```

### 4.2 Feature Importance for Business Insights

**üîç What Makes Properties Successful?**

```python
# Get feature importance from the classifier
feature_importance_clf = pd.DataFrame({
    'Feature': features,
    'Importance': clf.feature_importances_
})
feature_importance_clf = feature_importance_clf.sort_values('Importance', ascending=False)

print("üìà What Drives Property Success:")
print(feature_importance_clf.round(3))

# Visualize
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.barh(feature_importance_clf['Feature'], feature_importance_clf['Importance'])
plt.title('Features That Predict Property Success')
plt.xlabel('Importance')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### 4.3 Making Business Recommendations

**üíº Turning Model Insights into Strategy:**

```python
# Analyze successful vs unsuccessful properties
successful_props = ml_data[ml_data['is_successful'] == 1]
unsuccessful_props = ml_data[ml_data['is_successful'] == 0]

print("üí° Success Strategy Insights:")
print(f"Successful properties average price: ${successful_props['price'].mean():.0f}")
print(f"Unsuccessful properties average price: ${unsuccessful_props['price'].mean():.0f}")

print(f"\nSuccessful properties average availability: {successful_props['availability_365'].mean():.0f} days")
print(f"Unsuccessful properties average availability: {unsuccessful_props['availability_365'].mean():.0f} days")

# Optimal pricing strategy
optimal_price_range = successful_props['price'].quantile([0.25, 0.75])
print(f"\nüéØ Recommended Price Range for Success: ${optimal_price_range[0.25]:.0f} - ${optimal_price_range[0.75]:.0f}")
```
