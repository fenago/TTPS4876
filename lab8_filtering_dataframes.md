# Lab 8: Filtering DataFrames - Precision Data Selection

## Lab Objectives

**🎯 IMPORTANT NOTE:** Filtering is your superpower for finding exactly what you need in massive datasets! Instead of analyzing everything, successful data scientists precisely target the data that answers their business questions. We're going to master the art of asking "Show me only..." and getting exactly the insights that drive decisions.

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

1. **Think strategically about data selection** - Know what to look for before you look
2. **Master boolean logic for business decisions** - Turn business rules into filtering logic
3. **Apply multiple conditions efficiently** - Handle complex business criteria with confidence
4. **Optimize filtering for large datasets** - Work with millions of rows without waiting forever
5. **Design filtering workflows** - Create systematic approaches to data segmentation
6. **Extract targeted business intelligence** - Find specific insights that drive strategic decisions

## 📚 The Filtering Mindset - Strategic Data Selection

**🎯 Filtering = Business Intelligence Precision**

Think of filtering like a business executive asking targeted questions:
- **"Show me our top customers"** → Filter by purchase amount
- **"Which markets are underperforming?"** → Filter by sales metrics and location
- **"Find investment opportunities"** → Filter by multiple business criteria

## Step 1: Why Filtering Matters - The Business Case

### 1.1 The Precision Problem

**💼 Business Scenario:** You're analyzing 50,000 Airbnb properties, but your client only cares about luxury properties in Manhattan for international travelers.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load our data
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fenago/datasets/refs/heads/main/AirBnB_NYC_2019.csv"
airbnb_df = pd.read_csv(url)
print(f"Total dataset: {len(airbnb_df):,} properties")
```

**🤔 The Challenge:** Analyzing all 50,000 properties would be:
- **Overwhelming** - Too much irrelevant information
- **Misleading** - Budget properties would skew luxury market analysis
- **Inefficient** - Waste time on data that doesn't matter
- **Unfocused** - Miss specific insights in the noise

**💡 The Solution:** Precise filtering to get exactly what you need!

### 1.2 Business Questions Drive Filtering Strategy

**🎯 Strategic Thinking:** Before any filtering, ask yourself:

**Business Questions:**
1. **Who is my target customer/market?**
2. **What criteria define success in this context?**
3. **What would make me include or exclude a data point?**

**🏠 Airbnb Example:**
- **Target:** High-end rental opportunities
- **Criteria:** Manhattan location + Premium pricing + Good reviews
- **Include/Exclude:** Only properties that meet investment criteria

**💼 Business Benefit:** Focused analysis leads to actionable insights!

---

## Step 2: Basic Filtering - Your First Precision Tool

### 2.1 Simple Conditions - One Criteria

**🔍 The Simplest Question:** "Show me only expensive properties"

```python
# What qualifies as "expensive"?
expensive_properties = airbnb_df[airbnb_df['price'] > 200]
print(f"Properties over $200: {len(expensive_properties):,}")
```

**🤔 Before Running:** What percentage of properties do you think cost more than $200?

**💡 What Just Happened:**
1. `airbnb_df['price'] > 200` creates a **True/False list**
2. `airbnb_df[True/False list]` keeps only **True** rows
3. We get a new DataFrame with only expensive properties

### 2.2 Understanding Boolean Masks

**🎭 The Mask Concept:** Think of filtering like a mask that hides unwanted data.

```python
# Let's see the mask in action
price_mask = airbnb_df['price'] > 200
print(f"Mask type: {type(price_mask)}")
print(f"First 10 mask values: {price_mask.head(10).tolist()}")
```

**🤔 Observation:** The mask is just a Series of True/False values!

**💼 Business Translation:**
- **True** = "Include this property in my analysis"
- **False** = "This property doesn't meet my criteria"

### 2.3 Location-Based Filtering

**🗺️ Geographic Precision:** "Show me only Manhattan properties"

```python
manhattan_only = airbnb_df[airbnb_df['neighbourhood_group'] == 'Manhattan']
print(f"Manhattan properties: {len(manhattan_only):,}")
print(f"Percentage of total: {len(manhattan_only)/len(airbnb_df)*100:.1f}%")
```

**🎯 Your Analysis:** Is Manhattan overrepresented or underrepresented in this dataset?

**💡 String Filtering:** Use `==` for exact matches, not `=` (that's for assignment)

---

## Step 3: Multiple Conditions - Complex Business Logic

### 3.1 AND Logic - All Conditions Must Be True

**💼 Business Scenario:** "Show me expensive Manhattan properties with good reviews"

```python
# All three conditions must be true
premium_manhattan = airbnb_df[
    (airbnb_df['neighbourhood_group'] == 'Manhattan') &
    (airbnb_df['price'] > 200) &
    (airbnb_df['number_of_reviews'] > 10)
]
print(f"Premium Manhattan properties: {len(premium_manhattan):,}")
```

**🤔 Critical Syntax:**
- Use `&` for AND (not `and`)
- Put parentheses around each condition
- Each condition creates its own True/False mask

**💡 Business Logic:** This finds properties that are:
- **In Manhattan** AND
- **Expensive** AND  
- **Have customer validation (reviews)**

### 3.2 OR Logic - Any Condition Can Be True

**🎯 Business Scenario:** "Show me properties that are either very expensive OR have many reviews"

```python
# Either condition can be true
high_value = airbnb_df[
    (airbnb_df['price'] > 500) |
    (airbnb_df['number_of_reviews'] > 100)
]
print(f"High-value properties: {len(high_value):,}")
```

**💼 Business Translation:** This captures:
- **Luxury properties** (high price) OR
- **Popular properties** (many reviews) OR
- **Properties that are both**

### 3.3 Complex Business Criteria

**🏢 Real Business Example:** "Find investment opportunities: affordable but popular properties in growing markets"

```python
# Investment opportunity criteria
investment_targets = airbnb_df[
    (airbnb_df['price'] < 150) &  # Affordable entry point
    (airbnb_df['number_of_reviews'] > 20) &  # Proven demand
    (airbnb_df['neighbourhood_group'].isin(['Brooklyn', 'Queens']))  # Growing markets
]
print(f"Investment opportunities: {len(investment_targets):,}")
```

**🤔 New Technique:** `.isin(['Brooklyn', 'Queens'])` checks if value is in a list

**💡 Strategic Insight:** This filter finds properties that might be:
- **Undervalued** (affordable but popular)
- **In emerging markets** (Brooklyn/Queens growth)
- **Proven performers** (good review history)

---

## Step 4: Advanced Filtering Techniques

### 4.1 The Query Method - Readable Business Logic

**📝 Alternative Syntax:** Sometimes `.query()` is more readable for complex conditions.

```python
# Using query method for readability
luxury_rooms = airbnb_df.query(
    "neighbourhood_group == 'Manhattan' and price > 300 and room_type == 'Entire home/apt'"
)
print(f"Luxury entire homes in Manhattan: {len(luxury_rooms):,}")
```

**🤔 When to Use Query:**
- **Complex conditions** that are hard to read with &/|
- **Business logic** that reads like natural language
- **Dynamic filtering** where conditions change

### 4.2 Text-Based Filtering

**📝 Finding Patterns in Text:** "Show me properties with luxury keywords in their names"

```python
# Text filtering for marketing analysis
luxury_keywords = airbnb_df['name'].str.contains('luxury|premium|deluxe', case=False, na=False)
luxury_named = airbnb_df[luxury_keywords]
print(f"Properties with luxury keywords: {len(luxury_named):,}")
```

**💼 Business Application:** Do properties with luxury marketing actually charge premium prices?

```python
# Test the hypothesis
avg_luxury_price = luxury_named['price'].mean()
avg_regular_price = airbnb_df[~luxury_keywords]['price'].mean()
print(f"Luxury keyword average: ${avg_luxury_price:.2f}")
print(f"Regular property average: ${avg_regular_price:.2f}")
```

**🎯 Strategic Question:** Is the marketing premium justified?

### 4.3 Range-Based Filtering

**📊 Business Ranges:** "Show me mid-market properties (not too cheap, not too expensive)"

```python
# Mid-market sweet spot
mid_market = airbnb_df[
    airbnb_df['price'].between(75, 200)
]
print(f"Mid-market properties: {len(mid_market):,}")
print(f"Price range covers: {len(mid_market)/len(airbnb_df)*100:.1f}% of market")
```

**💡 Business Insight:** The `.between()` method is perfect for:
- **Market segments** (budget, mid-market, luxury)
- **Performance ranges** (low, medium, high performers)
- **Risk categories** (safe, moderate, aggressive)

---

## Step 5: Efficient Filtering for Large Datasets

### 5.1 Performance Considerations

**⚡ Speed Matters:** When working with millions of rows, filtering efficiency becomes critical.

```python
# Performance comparison setup
import time

# Method 1: Standard boolean indexing
start_time = time.time()
result1 = airbnb_df[(airbnb_df['price'] > 100) & (airbnb_df['price'] < 300)]
time1 = time.time() - start_time

# Method 2: Query method
start_time = time.time()
result2 = airbnb_df.query('price > 100 and price < 300')
time2 = time.time() - start_time

print(f"Boolean indexing: {time1:.4f} seconds")
print(f"Query method: {time2:.4f} seconds")
print(f"Results identical: {len(result1) == len(result2)}")
```

**💡 Performance Tip:** For complex conditions, `.query()` is often faster!

### 5.2 Memory-Efficient Filtering

**💾 Memory Management:** Working with large datasets requires smart memory usage.

```python
# Memory-efficient approach: filter before loading all columns
# Select only needed columns first
essential_columns = ['neighbourhood_group', 'room_type', 'price', 'number_of_reviews']
small_df = airbnb_df[essential_columns]

# Then filter
manhattan_small = small_df[small_df['neighbourhood_group'] == 'Manhattan']
print(f"Memory saved by column selection: ~{(len(airbnb_df.columns) - len(essential_columns))/len(airbnb_df.columns)*100:.1f}%")
```

**🎯 Strategy for Large Datasets:**
1. **Select columns first** (reduce width)
2. **Filter rows second** (reduce length)  
3. **Analyze the subset** (faster operations)

### 5.3 Filtering Workflow Design

**🔄 Systematic Approach:** Create reusable filtering workflows for common business questions.

```python
def find_investment_opportunities(df, max_price=200, min_reviews=15, target_boroughs=['Brooklyn', 'Queens']):
    """Find properties that meet investment criteria"""
    opportunities = df[
        (df['price'] <= max_price) &
        (df['number_of_reviews'] >= min_reviews) &
        (df['neighbourhood_group'].isin(target_boroughs))
    ]
    return opportunities

# Use the workflow
opportunities = find_investment_opportunities(airbnb_df)
print(f"Found {len(opportunities):,} investment opportunities")
```

**💼 Business Benefit:** Reusable workflows ensure:
- **Consistency** across analyses
- **Efficiency** in repeated tasks
- **Flexibility** to adjust criteria
- **Scalability** for different datasets

<summary>🔍 Hint 1: Multi-Stage Filtering</summary>

Build complex criteria step by step:
```python
# Stage 1: Geographic focus
target_areas = df[df['neighbourhood_group'].isin(['Brooklyn', 'Queens'])]

# Stage 2: Price criteria  
affordable_range = target_areas[target_areas['price'].between(75, 200)]

final_targets = affordable_range[affordable_range['number_of_reviews'] > 20]
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>🔍 Hint 2: Performance-Based Filtering</summary>

Use percentiles for relative performance:
```python
# Find top quartile performers
top_25_percent_threshold = df['number_of_reviews'].quantile(0.75)
high_performers = df[df['number_of_reviews'] >= top_25_percent_threshold]
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>🔍 Hint 3: Custom Business Logic</summary>

Create meaningful business categories:
```python
def calculate_value_score(row):
    # Custom scoring logic based on multiple factors
    price_score = 100 - min(row['price'] / 10, 50)  # Lower price = higher score
    demand_score = min(row['number_of_reviews'], 50)  # More reviews = higher score
    return price_score + demand_score

df['value_score'] = df.apply(calculate_value_score, axis=1)
top_value = df[df['value_score'] >= df['value_score'].quantile(0.8)]
