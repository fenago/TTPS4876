# Appendix 3: Discovering Pulsars with Machine Learning

## Why Hunt for Cosmic Lighthouses?

**🌌 The Big Picture:** Somewhere in the vast darkness of space, there are cosmic lighthouses called pulsars - ultra-dense stars that spin hundreds of times per second, beaming radio waves across the universe like cosmic beacons.

**🔬 Your Mission:** Help astronomers find these rare cosmic gems hidden among millions of false signals using machine learning. 

**💡 Why This Matters:**
- Pulsars help us understand extreme physics (imagine a teaspoon of pulsar matter weighing 6 billion tons!)
- They're used as cosmic GPS systems for spacecraft navigation
- They test Einstein's theories in extreme conditions
- Finding them manually would take astronomers centuries

**🥚 Easter Egg #1:** The first pulsar was discovered in 1967 by Jocelyn Bell Burnell, who initially thought the regular signals might be from aliens! They nicknamed it "LGM-1" (Little Green Men-1). 👽

## Step 1: Understanding Your Cosmic Detective Work

### 1.1 What Are We Actually Looking For?

**🤔 Before diving into data, let's understand what makes a pulsar special:**

Imagine you're in a dark room with a lighthouse far away. Every few seconds, you see a brief flash of light. That's essentially what a pulsar does, but with radio waves instead of visible light.

**🎯 The Challenge:** For every real pulsar signal, there are thousands of false alarms caused by:
- Radio interference from human technology
- Cosmic noise from other sources  
- Random statistical fluctuations
- Equipment glitches

**💡 Your Role:** Build a machine learning system that can tell the difference between real pulsars and cosmic "noise."

Let's start by looking at our data:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the pulsar dataset
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fenago/datasets/refs/heads/main/HTRU_2.csv"
pulsar_data = pd.read_csv(url)

print("🌌 HTRU-2 Pulsar Survey Data Loaded")
print(f"📊 Total observations: {len(pulsar_data):,}")
print(f"📋 Features available: {pulsar_data.shape[1]}")
```

**📝 Your First Investigation:** Run this code and answer:
1. How many cosmic objects did we observe?
2. How many different measurements do we have for each object?
3. What do you think each row represents?

**🤔 Stop and Think:** If you were an astronomer, what would you measure about a potential pulsar signal to determine if it's real?

### 1.2 Understanding the Data Structure

```python
# Let's see what our data looks like
print("🔍 First glimpse of our cosmic data:")
print(pulsar_data.head(3))

print(f"\n📊 Data shape: {pulsar_data.shape}")
print(f"📋 Column names: {list(pulsar_data.columns)}")
```

**🤔 Observation Challenge:** Look at the output. The column names aren't very descriptive! Let's figure out what each measurement means.

Based on Dr. Ernesto Lee's research and the HTRU-2 dataset documentation, let's give these columns meaningful names:

```python
# Give our features meaningful names based on pulsar research
feature_names = [
    'mean_integrated_profile',      # Average signal strength
    'std_integrated_profile',       # How much signal varies
    'excess_kurtosis_profile',      # Is signal spiky or smooth?
    'skewness_profile',             # Is signal symmetric?
    'mean_dm_snr_curve',            # Signal clarity across frequencies
    'std_dm_snr_curve',             # Consistency across frequencies  
    'excess_kurtosis_dm_curve',     # Distribution shape
    'skewness_dm_curve',            # Asymmetry in signal
    'is_pulsar'                     # True answer: 1=pulsar, 0=noise
]

pulsar_data.columns = feature_names
print("✅ Data columns renamed for clarity")
print(pulsar_data.head(2))
```

**💡 Understanding Check:** Now the data makes more sense! Each row represents one potential pulsar observation with 8 different measurements.

**📝 Your Turn:** Look at the first few rows. Do you notice anything interesting about the 'is_pulsar' column values?

---

## Step 2: The Rare Treasure Hunt Challenge

### 2.1 How Rare Are Real Pulsars?

**🎯 Critical Question:** Before building any model, we need to understand what we're looking for.

```python
# Count how many pulsars vs noise signals we have
pulsar_counts = pulsar_data['is_pulsar'].value_counts()
total_observations = len(pulsar_data)

print("🌌 Cosmic Signal Analysis:")
print(f"Noise signals (0): {pulsar_counts[0]:,}")
print(f"Real pulsars (1): {pulsar_counts[1]:,}")

# Calculate the rarity
pulsar_rate = pulsar_counts[1] / total_observations
print(f"\n🔍 Pulsar discovery rate: {pulsar_rate:.2%}")
print(f"📊 For every pulsar, there are {pulsar_counts[0]/pulsar_counts[1]:.0f} false signals!")
```

**🤯 Mind-Blowing Realization:** Run this code and see how rare pulsars actually are!

**📝 Reflection Questions:**
1. Were you surprised by how rare pulsars are?
2. What challenges might this create for machine learning?
3. If you had to find pulsars manually, how long do you think it would take?

**💡 The Imbalance Problem:** This is what researchers call "class imbalance" - when one category is much rarer than another. Dr. Lee's research specifically addresses this challenge in pulsar detection.

### 2.2 Visualizing the Rarity

```python
# Let's visualize this cosmic rarity
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 4))

# Pie chart showing the imbalance
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
plt.pie([pulsar_counts[0], pulsar_counts[1]], 
        labels=['Noise', 'Pulsars'], 
        autopct='%1.1f%%',
        colors=['lightgray', 'gold'])
plt.title('Cosmic Signal Distribution')

# Bar chart for exact numbers
plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
plt.bar(['Noise Signals', 'Real Pulsars'], [pulsar_counts[0], pulsar_counts[1]], 
        color=['lightgray', 'gold'])
plt.ylabel('Number of Observations')
plt.title('Pulsar Rarity in Numbers')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

print(f"🎯 Key Insight: Pulsars are like finding {pulsar_counts[1]} needles in a haystack of {total_observations:,} observations!")
```

**🤔 Think About It:** Why might this extreme rarity make machine learning challenging?

**💡 Hint:** Imagine trying to learn to recognize a rare bird species when you only see 1 example for every 50 common birds!

---

## Step 3: Understanding Pulsar Signals Step by Step

### 3.1 What Makes a Pulsar Signal Unique?

**🔬 Scientific Approach:** Let's examine the characteristics that distinguish real pulsars from noise, one feature at a time.

**💡 Learning Strategy:** We'll look at each measurement individually to build intuition before combining them.

```python
# Let's examine the first feature: mean signal strength
feature_to_examine = 'mean_integrated_profile'

print(f"🔍 Examining: {feature_to_examine}")
print(f"This measures: Average signal strength of the observation")

# Compare pulsars vs noise for this feature
pulsars = pulsar_data[pulsar_data['is_pulsar'] == 1]
noise = pulsar_data[pulsar_data['is_pulsar'] == 0]

print(f"\n📊 Signal Strength Comparison:")
print(f"Real pulsars - Average: {pulsars[feature_to_examine].mean():.3f}")
print(f"Noise signals - Average: {noise[feature_to_examine].mean():.3f}")
print(f"Real pulsars - Range: {pulsars[feature_to_examine].min():.3f} to {pulsars[feature_to_examine].max():.3f}")
print(f"Noise signals - Range: {noise[feature_to_examine].min():.3f} to {noise[feature_to_examine].max():.3f}")
```

**📝 Your Analysis:** After running this code, answer:
1. Do real pulsars have higher or lower average signal strength than noise?
2. Is there overlap between pulsar and noise ranges?
3. Could you identify pulsars using just this one measurement?

### 3.2 Visualizing the Difference

```python
# Create a comparison histogram
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))

# Plot histograms for both classes
plt.hist(noise[feature_to_examine], bins=50, alpha=0.7, label='Noise', color='lightgray', density=True)
plt.hist(pulsars[feature_to_examine], bins=50, alpha=0.7, label='Pulsars', color='gold', density=True)

plt.xlabel(feature_to_examine.replace('_', ' ').title())
plt.ylabel('Density')
plt.title('Signal Strength: Pulsars vs Noise')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

# Calculate separation between groups
separation = abs(pulsars[feature_to_examine].mean() - noise[feature_to_examine].mean())
print(f"🎯 Separation between groups: {separation:.3f}")
```

**🤔 Visual Analysis Challenge:**
1. Do the distributions overlap significantly?
2. Could you draw a line to separate most pulsars from noise?
3. What does this tell you about using this feature alone?

**💡 Discovery:** You've just done what's called "exploratory data analysis" - exactly what real astronomers do when studying pulsar data!

### 3.3 Exploring Multiple Features

**🔬 Expanding Our Investigation:** Let's look at a different type of measurement.

```python
# Now let's examine signal variability
feature_2 = 'std_integrated_profile'

print(f"🔍 Now examining: {feature_2}")
print(f"This measures: How much the signal strength varies (consistency)")

print(f"\n📊 Signal Variability Comparison:")
print(f"Real pulsars - Average variability: {pulsars[feature_2].mean():.3f}")
print(f"Noise signals - Average variability: {noise[feature_2].mean():.3f}")

# Quick visualization
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
plt.hist(noise[feature_2], bins=30, alpha=0.7, label='Noise', color='lightgray', density=True)
plt.hist(pulsars[feature_2], bins=30, alpha=0.7, label='Pulsars', color='gold', density=True)
plt.xlabel('Signal Variability')
plt.ylabel('Density') 
plt.title('Signal Variability: Pulsars vs Noise')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

**📝 Your Comparison:** 
1. How does this feature differ from the first one?
2. Which feature seems better at separating pulsars from noise?
3. Do you think combining features might work better than using them individually?

**🧠 Building Intuition:** You're learning that different measurements capture different aspects of pulsar signals. Real astronomers use this same approach!

---

## Step 4: Building Your First Pulsar Detector

### 4.1 Starting Simple and Smart

**💡 Key Principle:** Don't try to use all features at once. Start with the most promising ones and build understanding.

**🎯 Your First Model:** Let's use just the two features you explored to build a simple pulsar detector.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Select your first two features
simple_features = ['mean_integrated_profile', 'std_integrated_profile']

print("🚀 Building Your First Pulsar Detector")
print(f"Using features: {simple_features}")

# Prepare the data
X_simple = pulsar_data[simple_features]
y = pulsar_data['is_pulsar']

print(f"📊 Data prepared: {X_simple.shape[0]} observations, {X_simple.shape[1]} features")
```

**🤔 Prediction Time:** Before we train the model, what accuracy do you think we'll achieve?
- Above 90%? 
- Around 80%?
- Below 70%?

Make your prediction and let's find out!

### 4.2 The Train-Test Split Concept (Reviewed)

```python
# Split data for honest evaluation
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X_simple, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=y
)

print("📚 Data split for evaluation:")
print(f"Training set: {len(X_train):,} observations")
print(f"Test set: {len(X_test):,} observations")

# Check that we maintained the rarity in both sets
train_pulsar_rate = y_train.mean()
test_pulsar_rate = y_test.mean()

print(f"Training set pulsar rate: {train_pulsar_rate:.2%}")
print(f"Test set pulsar rate: {test_pulsar_rate:.2%}")
```

**✅ Quality Check:** The pulsar rates should be similar in both sets. This ensures fair evaluation.

### 4.3 Training Your Cosmic Detector

```python
# Create and train your pulsar detector
print("🤖 Training your pulsar detection model...")

detector = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
detector.fit(X_train, y_train)

print("✅ Training complete!")

# Make predictions
predictions = detector.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)

print(f"🎯 Model accuracy: {accuracy:.1%}")
```

**📝 Results Analysis:**
1. How did your prediction compare to the actual accuracy?
2. Are you satisfied with this performance?
3. What might explain the accuracy level you achieved?

**🤔 Critical Thinking:** Remember that 91% of our signals are noise. What would happen if our model just predicted "noise" for everything?

### 4.4 Understanding What "Accuracy" Really Means

```python
# Let's dig deeper than just accuracy
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, classification_report

# Calculate detailed performance metrics
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, predictions)
print("🔍 Detailed Performance Analysis:")
print("Confusion Matrix:")
print("                 Predicted")
print("              Noise  Pulsar")
print(f"Actual Noise   {cm[0,0]:4d}    {cm[0,1]:4d}")
print(f"       Pulsar  {cm[1,0]:4d}    {cm[1,1]:4d}")

# Calculate the key metrics for astronomy
true_negatives, false_positives, false_negatives, true_positives = cm.ravel()

# How many pulsars did we actually find?
recall = true_positives / (true_positives + false_negatives)
precision = true_positives / (true_positives + false_positives)

print(f"\n🌌 Astronomical Performance:")
print(f"✅ Pulsars correctly identified: {true_positives} out of {true_positives + false_negatives}")
print(f"❌ Pulsars we missed: {false_negatives}")
print(f"❌ False alarms: {false_positives}")

print(f"\n📊 Key Metrics:")
print(f"Recall: {recall:.1%} (percentage of real pulsars we found)")
print(f"Precision: {precision:.1%} (when we say 'pulsar', we're right {precision:.1%} of the time)")
```

**💡 Astronomical Reality Check:** 
- **High Recall** is crucial - we don't want to miss discovering pulsars!
- **High Precision** saves time - we don't want to waste telescope time on false alarms

**📝 Your Evaluation:**
1. Which metric do you think is more important for astronomy?
2. Are you happy with how many pulsars the model found?
3. What could be improved?

---

## Step 5: The Feature Importance Discovery

### 5.1 What Did Your Model Learn?

**🔍 Understanding Your Detector:** Let's see which measurements your model found most useful.

```python
# Examine feature importance
feature_importance = detector.feature_importances_

print("🧠 What your model learned:")
for feature, importance in zip(simple_features, feature_importance):
    print(f"{feature}: {importance:.3f}")

# Visualize the importance
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
plt.bar(simple_features, feature_importance, color=['skyblue', 'lightcoral'])
plt.title('Feature Importance in Pulsar Detection')
plt.ylabel('Importance Score')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

most_important = simple_features[np.argmax(feature_importance)]
print(f"\n🏆 Most important measurement: {most_important}")
```

**🤔 Scientific Interpretation:**
1. Which measurement was more useful for finding pulsars?
2. Does this match what you observed in your data exploration?
3. What does this tell you about pulsar signal characteristics?

**💡 Real Astronomy Connection:** Dr. Lee's research shows that signal strength and variability measurements are indeed among the most discriminative features for pulsar detection!

### 5.2 Testing Individual Predictions

Let's see how your model performs on specific examples:

```python
# Test your model on specific cosmic signals
print("🔮 Testing specific cosmic observations:")

# Get a few test examples
test_examples = X_test.head(5)
test_labels = y_test.head(5)
test_predictions = detector.predict(test_examples)
test_probabilities = detector.predict_proba(test_examples)

for i in range(len(test_examples)):
    actual = "PULSAR" if test_labels.iloc[i] else "NOISE"
    predicted = "PULSAR" if test_predictions[i] else "NOISE"
    confidence = test_probabilities[i][1] * 100  # Probability of being a pulsar
    
    print(f"\nObservation {i+1}:")
    print(f"  Actual: {actual}")
    print(f"  Predicted: {predicted}")
    print(f"  Confidence: {confidence:.1f}% chance of being a pulsar")
    
    if actual == predicted:
        print(f"  ✅ Correct prediction!")
    else:
        print(f"  ❌ Missed this one")
```

**📝 Individual Analysis:**
1. How confident was the model in its predictions?
2. Did it make any mistakes in these examples?
3. What confidence level would you require before claiming a pulsar discovery?

---

## Step 6: Improving Your Cosmic Detector

### 6.1 Adding More Features

**🚀 Enhancing Performance:** Now let's see if adding more measurements improves our pulsar detection.

**🤔 Your Hypothesis:** Do you think adding more features will:
- Definitely improve performance?
- Possibly improve performance?
- Not make much difference?
- Actually hurt performance?

Make your prediction, then let's find out!

```python
# Use more features from the astronomical data
enhanced_features = [
    'mean_integrated_profile',
    'std_integrated_profile', 
    'excess_kurtosis_profile',
    'skewness_profile',
    'mean_dm_snr_curve'
]

print(f"🔬 Enhanced detector using {len(enhanced_features)} features:")
for i, feature in enumerate(enhanced_features, 1):
    print(f"  {i}. {feature}")

# Prepare enhanced dataset
X_enhanced = pulsar_data[enhanced_features]
X_train_enh, X_test_enh, y_train_enh, y_test_enh = train_test_split(
    X_enhanced, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=y
)

print(f"\n📊 Enhanced data: {X_enhanced.shape[1]} features")
```

### 6.2 Training the Enhanced Model

```python
# Train the enhanced model
print("🤖 Training enhanced pulsar detector...")

enhanced_detector = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
enhanced_detector.fit(X_train_enh, y_train_enh)

# Compare performance
enhanced_predictions = enhanced_detector.predict(X_test_enh)
enhanced_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test_enh, enhanced_predictions)

print("📊 Performance Comparison:")
print(f"Simple model (2 features):   {accuracy:.1%}")
print(f"Enhanced model (5 features): {enhanced_accuracy:.1%}")

improvement = enhanced_accuracy - accuracy
print(f"Improvement: {improvement:.1%}")

if improvement > 0:
    print("✅ Adding features helped!")
elif improvement < 0:
    print("❌ Adding features hurt performance")
else:
    print("➖ No significant change")
```

**📝 Your Analysis:**
1. Did your hypothesis about adding features prove correct?
2. Was the improvement significant or minimal?
3. What might explain the result you observed?

### 6.3 Understanding the Enhanced Model

```python
# Analyze what the enhanced model learned
enhanced_importance = enhanced_detector.feature_importances_

print("🧠 Enhanced model feature importance:")
importance_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'feature': enhanced_features,
    'importance': enhanced_importance
}).sort_values('importance', ascending=False)

for _, row in importance_df.iterrows():
    print(f"{row['feature']}: {row['importance']:.3f}")

# Visualize all feature importance
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.barh(range(len(importance_df)), importance_df['importance'])
plt.yticks(range(len(importance_df)), importance_df['feature'])
plt.xlabel('Feature Importance')
plt.title('Feature Importance in Enhanced Pulsar Detector')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

top_feature = importance_df.iloc[0]['feature']
print(f"\n🏆 Most valuable measurement: {top_feature}")
```

**🔬 Scientific Discovery:** You've just discovered which astronomical measurements are most valuable for finding pulsars - the same insights professional astronomers use!

---

## Step 7: Handling the Extreme Rarity Challenge

### 7.1 The Imbalanced Data Problem

**⚖️ The Challenge:** Remember how rare pulsars are? This creates a special challenge called "class imbalance."

**🤔 Think About It:** What happens if our model just predicts "noise" for everything?

```python
# Let's test this hypothesis
always_noise_accuracy = (y_test == 0).mean()
print(f"🎯 'Always predict noise' accuracy: {always_noise_accuracy:.1%}")
print(f"🤖 Our model accuracy: {enhanced_accuracy:.1%}")

print(f"\n💡 Insight: Our model is only {enhanced_accuracy - always_noise_accuracy:.1%} better than always guessing 'noise'!")
```

**🤯 Surprising Result:** High accuracy doesn't always mean a good model when data is imbalanced!

### 7.2 Better Metrics for Rare Events

**📊 Focusing on What Matters:** For rare events like pulsars, we need different metrics.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import precision_score, recall_score, f1_score

# Calculate metrics that matter for rare events
enhanced_cm = confusion_matrix(y_test_enh, enhanced_predictions)
enhanced_precision = precision_score(y_test_enh, enhanced_predictions)
enhanced_recall = recall_score(y_test_enh, enhanced_predictions)
enhanced_f1 = f1_score(y_test_enh, enhanced_predictions)

print("🔍 Pulsar-Focused Performance Metrics:")
print(f"Precision: {enhanced_precision:.1%} (when we say 'pulsar', how often are we right?)")
print(f"Recall: {enhanced_recall:.1%} (what percentage of real pulsars do we find?)")
print(f"F1-Score: {enhanced_f1:.1%} (balanced measure of both)")

# Break down the confusion matrix
tn, fp, fn, tp = enhanced_cm.ravel()
print(f"\n🌌 Detailed Results:")
print(f"✅ True pulsars found: {tp}")
print(f"❌ Pulsars missed: {fn}")
print(f"❌ False alarms: {fp}")
print(f"✅ Correctly identified noise: {tn}")

# Calculate discovery efficiency
discovery_rate = tp / (tp + fn) if (tp + fn) > 0 else 0
false_alarm_rate = fp / (fp + tn) if (fp + tn) > 0 else 0

print(f"\n📈 Astronomical Efficiency:")
print(f"Discovery rate: {discovery_rate:.1%} of real pulsars found")
print(f"False alarm rate: {false_alarm_rate:.1%} of noise incorrectly flagged")
```

**📝 Critical Evaluation:**
1. Are you satisfied with the discovery rate?
2. Is the false alarm rate acceptable?
3. Which would be worse for astronomy: missing pulsars or having false alarms?

### 7.3 Improving Rare Event Detection

**🎯 Optimization Strategy:** Let's adjust our model to be better at finding rare pulsars.

```python
# Train a model optimized for finding rare events
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

print("🔧 Optimizing for rare pulsar detection...")

# Use class weights to handle imbalance
optimized_detector = RandomForestClassifier(
    n_estimators=100, 
    random_state=42,
    class_weight='balanced'  # This helps with imbalanced data
)

optimized_detector.fit(X_train_enh, y_train_enh)

# Test the optimized model
optimized_predictions = optimized_detector.predict(X_test_enh)
optimized_precision = precision_score(y_test_enh, optimized_predictions)
optimized_recall = recall_score(y_test_enh, optimized_predictions)
optimized_f1 = f1_score(y_test_enh, optimized_predictions)

print("📊 Optimization Results:")
print(f"Original model:")
print(f"  Precision: {enhanced_precision:.1%}, Recall: {enhanced_recall:.1%}, F1: {enhanced_f1:.1%}")
print(f"Optimized model:")
print(f"  Precision: {optimized_precision:.1%}, Recall: {optimized_recall:.1%}, F1: {optimized_f1:.1%}")

# Which improved and which got worse?
precision_change = optimized_precision - enhanced_precision
recall_change = optimized_recall - enhanced_recall

print(f"\n📈 Changes:")
print(f"Precision: {precision_change:+.1%}")
print(f"Recall: {recall_change:+.1%}")
```

**🤔 Trade-off Analysis:**
1. Did optimizing for imbalance help find more pulsars?
2. Was there a cost in terms of false alarms?
3. Which model would you choose for real astronomy research?

**💡 Real Research Connection:** This trade-off between precision and recall is exactly what Dr. Lee addressed in his pulsar research - it's a fundamental challenge in astronomical discovery!

---

## Step 8: Making Astronomical Discoveries

### 8.1 Creating a Pulsar Discovery System

**🔭 From Model to Discovery:** Let's turn your classifier into a practical pulsar discovery tool.

```python
class PulsarDiscoverySystem:
    """
    A system for discovering pulsars from astronomical observations.
    Based on machine learning classification of radio telescope data.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, model, feature_names):
        self.model = model
        self.feature_names = feature_names
        self.discoveries = []
    
    def analyze_observation(self, observation_data, observation_id="Unknown"):
        """
        Analyze a single astronomical observation for pulsar signals.
        """
        # Make prediction
        is_pulsar = self.model.predict([observation_data])[0]
        confidence = self.model.predict_proba([observation_data])[0][1]
        
        # Determine confidence level
        if confidence > 0.9:
            confidence_level = "Very High"
        elif confidence > 0.7:
            confidence_level = "High"
        elif confidence > 0.5:
            confidence_level = "Moderate"
        else:
            confidence_level = "Low"
        
        result = {
            'observation_id': observation_id,
            'is_pulsar': bool(is_pulsar),
            'confidence': float(confidence),
            'confidence_level': confidence_level,
            'recommendation': self._get_recommendation(confidence, is_pulsar)
        }
        
        if is_pulsar:
            self.discoveries.append(result)
        
        return result
    
    def _get_recommendation(self, confidence, is_pulsar):
        """Generate recommendation based on prediction."""
        if is_pulsar and confidence > 0.8:
            return "STRONG CANDIDATE - Schedule follow-up observations"
        elif is_pulsar and confidence > 0.6:
            return "POSSIBLE CANDIDATE - Consider follow-up"
        elif is_pulsar:
            return "WEAK CANDIDATE - Low priority for follow-up"
        else:
            return "LIKELY NOISE - No action needed"

# Create your discovery system
discovery_system = PulsarDiscoverySystem(optimized_detector, enhanced_features)

print("🔭 Pulsar Discovery System Created!")
print("Ready to analyze cosmic observations...")
```

### 8.2 Testing Your Discovery System

```python
# Test your system on some real observations
print("🌌 Testing Discovery System on Real Observations:")
print("=" * 55)

# Take a few test observations
test_observations = X_test_enh.head(10)
actual_labels = y_test_enh.head(10)

    telescope_cost_per_hour = 10000   # cost of major radio telescope
    
    # Calculate manual analysis time
    total_manual_hours = (total_observations * manual_time_per_observation) / 60
    total_manual_cost = total_manual_hours * telescope_cost_per_hour
    
    # Calculate ML efficiency
    ml_analysis_time_per_observation = 0.1  # seconds
