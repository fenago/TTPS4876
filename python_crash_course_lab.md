# Lab 3: Python Crash Course - Business Programming Fundamentals

## Lab Objectives

**🎯 IMPORTANT NOTE:** Python is the language of business analytics and data science. Instead of just memorizing syntax, we'll learn programming by solving real business problems. Every concept you learn will immediately apply to analyzing data, automating decisions, and creating business value.

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

1. **Master Python fundamentals** - Variables, data types, and basic operations for business calculations
2. **Build decision logic** - Use if/then/else statements to automate business decisions
3. **Automate repetitive work** - Use loops to process business data efficiently
4. **Create reusable solutions** - Write functions that solve business problems
5. **Think in objects** - Organize business logic using classes and objects
6. **Process real data** - Apply Python to actual business datasets

## 📚 Why Python for Business?

**🐍 Python vs. Spreadsheets:**
- **Spreadsheets**: Manual, error-prone, limited to small datasets
- **Python**: Automated, reliable, handles millions of records

**💼 What You'll Build Today:**
- Automated pricing calculator
- Customer classification system  
- Revenue analysis tool
- Investment decision engine

**🎯 Learning Approach:** Start simple, build complexity gradually, always with business context.

## Step 1: Variables and Data Types - Storing Business Information

### 1.1 Your First Business Program

Let's start with something you already understand - business metrics:

```python
# Your first business calculation
company_name = "NYC Property Ventures"
monthly_revenue = 125000
profit_margin = 0.15

print(f"Company: {company_name}")
print(f"Monthly Revenue: ${monthly_revenue:,}")
print(f"Profit Margin: {profit_margin:.1%}")
```

**🤔 What Just Happened?**
- **Variables** store business information (like cells in Excel)
- **Strings** store text (`company_name`)
- **Integers** store whole numbers (`monthly_revenue`)
- **Floats** store decimals (`profit_margin`)
- **f-strings** format output nicely

**💡 Try This:** Change the values and run it again. See how variables work like labeled boxes that hold information.

### 1.2 Essential Business Data Types

```python
# Every business data type you'll need
property_name = "Downtown Luxury Suite"          # String - text data
nightly_rate = 299                              # Integer - whole numbers  
occupancy_rate = 0.847                          # Float - decimal numbers
is_available = True                             # Boolean - True/False
amenities = ["WiFi", "Pool", "Gym", "Parking"] # List - multiple items
property_info = {                               # Dictionary - structured data
    "bedrooms": 2,
    "bathrooms": 2,
    "square_feet": 1200
}

print("📊 Property Analysis:")
print(f"Property: {property_name}")
print(f"Rate: ${nightly_rate}/night")
print(f"Occupancy: {occupancy_rate:.1%}")
print(f"Available: {is_available}")
print(f"Amenities: {len(amenities)} features")
print(f"Size: {property_info['square_feet']} sq ft")
```

**🎯 Business Insight:** Each data type serves a specific business purpose:
- **Strings**: Names, descriptions, categories
- **Numbers**: Prices, quantities, percentages  
- **Booleans**: Yes/no decisions, status flags
- **Lists**: Multiple related items
- **Dictionaries**: Structured information

**💡 Practice:** Create variables for a different property. Try changing values and see what happens.

### 1.3 Calculations That Matter

```python
# Real business calculations
nights_per_month = 30
monthly_gross = nightly_rate * nights_per_month * occupancy_rate
operating_costs = monthly_gross * 0.25  # 25% operating costs
monthly_profit = monthly_gross - operating_costs

print("💰 Financial Analysis:")
print(f"Monthly Gross Revenue: ${monthly_gross:,.0f}")
print(f"Operating Costs: ${operating_costs:,.0f}")
print(f"Monthly Profit: ${monthly_profit:,.0f}")
print(f"Annual Profit: ${monthly_profit * 12:,.0f}")
```

**🤔 Why This Matters:** These calculations would take forever in your head, but Python does them instantly and accurately.

---

## Step 2: If/Then/Else - Automating Business Decisions

### 2.1 Your First Business Decision

**💡 The Problem:** Should we raise prices based on demand?

```python
# Business scenario: Dynamic pricing
current_price = 200
booking_requests = 15  # This week
available_days = 7

demand_ratio = booking_requests / available_days

print(f"📈 Demand Analysis:")
print(f"Current Price: ${current_price}")
print(f"Demand Ratio: {demand_ratio:.1f} requests per day")

# The business decision logic
if demand_ratio > 2.0:
    new_price = current_price * 1.2  # Increase by 20%
    action = "INCREASE PRICE - High demand!"
elif demand_ratio > 1.0:
    new_price = current_price  # Keep same
    action = "MAINTAIN PRICE - Good demand"
else:
    new_price = current_price * 0.9  # Decrease by 10%
    action = "DECREASE PRICE - Low demand"

print(f"💡 Decision: {action}")
print(f"💰 New Price: ${new_price:.0f}")
```

**🎯 What You Just Learned:**
- **if** - Tests a condition and runs code if true
- **elif** - Tests another condition if the first was false  
- **else** - Runs if no conditions were true
- **Comparison operators** - `>`, `<`, `==`, `>=`, `<=`

**🤔 Business Value:** This replaces manual decision-making with consistent, automated logic.

### 2.2 Complex Business Logic

Let's handle a more realistic scenario:

```python
# Customer classification for personalized pricing
annual_bookings = 8
customer_rating = 4.8
years_as_customer = 3
total_spent = 12000

print(f"👤 Customer Profile:")
print(f"Annual Bookings: {annual_bookings}")
print(f"Rating: {customer_rating}/5.0")
print(f"Customer for: {years_as_customer} years")
print(f"Total Spent: ${total_spent:,}")

# Multi-factor business decision
if total_spent > 10000 and years_as_customer >= 2:
    if customer_rating >= 4.5:
        tier = "VIP PLATINUM"
        discount = 0.25
    else:
        tier = "VIP GOLD"
        discount = 0.20
elif total_spent > 5000 or annual_bookings >= 6:
    tier = "PREFERRED"
    discount = 0.15
elif years_as_customer >= 1:
    tier = "VALUED"
    discount = 0.10
else:
    tier = "STANDARD"
    discount = 0.05

discounted_price = current_price * (1 - discount)

print(f"\n🏆 Customer Tier: {tier}")
print(f"💳 Discount: {discount:.0%}")
print(f"💰 Your Price: ${discounted_price:.0f}")
```

**🔥 Advanced Concepts:**
- **Nested if statements** - Decisions within decisions
- **Multiple conditions** - Using `and`, `or` 
- **Complex business logic** - Real-world decision trees

**💡 Try This:** Change the customer values and see how the tier changes. This is how real businesses automate customer treatment!

---

## Step 3: Loops - Processing Business Data at Scale

### 3.1 For Loops - When You Need to Repeat

**💡 The Problem:** Analyze multiple properties quickly.

```python
# Sample property data
properties = [
    {"name": "Downtown Suite", "price": 250, "bookings": 22},
    {"name": "Midtown Loft", "price": 180, "bookings": 28},
    {"name": "Brooklyn House", "price": 120, "bookings": 15},
    {"name": "Queens Apartment", "price": 95, "bookings": 12}
]

print("🏢 Property Performance Analysis:")
print("=" * 50)

total_revenue = 0

# Process each property automatically
for property_data in properties:
    name = property_data["name"]
    price = property_data["price"]
    bookings = property_data["bookings"]
    
    # Calculate metrics for this property
    revenue = price * bookings
    total_revenue += revenue
    
    # Determine performance category
    if revenue > 5000:
        performance = "🔥 EXCELLENT"
    elif revenue > 3000:
        performance = "📈 GOOD"
    else:
        performance = "⚠️ NEEDS ATTENTION"
    
    print(f"{name}:")
    print(f"  ${price}/night × {bookings} bookings = ${revenue:,}")
    print(f"  Performance: {performance}")
    print()

print(f"💰 Total Portfolio Revenue: ${total_revenue:,}")
```

**🎯 What For Loops Do:**
- **Repeat actions** for each item in a list
- **Process data consistently** - same logic for every item
- **Scale your analysis** - handle 4 properties or 4,000 properties

**🤔 Without Loops:** You'd need to copy the same code for each property. With 100 properties, that's 100 copies!

### 3.2 While Loops - Keep Going Until Done

**💡 The Problem:** Find the optimal price through testing.

```python
# Price optimization through iteration
base_price = 100
target_revenue = 5000
current_price = base_price
test_bookings = 20

print("🎯 Finding Optimal Price for ${:,} target revenue".format(target_revenue))
print("=" * 55)

attempts = 0

while current_price * test_bookings < target_revenue:
    attempts += 1
    projected_revenue = current_price * test_bookings
    
    print(f"Attempt {attempts}: ${current_price} × {test_bookings} = ${projected_revenue:,}")
    
    if projected_revenue < target_revenue:
        shortage = target_revenue - projected_revenue
        price_increase = shortage / test_bookings
        current_price += price_increase
        print(f"  Need ${shortage:,} more → increase price by ${price_increase:.0f}")
    
    # Safety check to prevent infinite loops
    if attempts > 10:
        print("  Stopping after 10 attempts")
        break
    
    print()

print(f"✅ Optimal Price Found: ${current_price:.0f}")
print(f"📊 Final Revenue: ${current_price * test_bookings:,.0f}")
```

**🎯 While Loops:**
- **Continue until condition is met** - Keep trying until you succeed
- **Handle unknown repetitions** - Don't know how many tries it will take
- **Process until complete** - Keep going until job is done

**⚠️ Important:** Always include a way to stop (like our `attempts > 10` check) to prevent infinite loops!

---

## Step 4: Functions - Creating Reusable Business Tools

### 4.1 Your First Business Function

**💡 The Problem:** You keep calculating the same metrics over and over.

```python
# Instead of repeating calculations...
def calculate_property_metrics(price, bookings, operating_cost_rate=0.25):
    """
    Calculate key financial metrics for a property.
    
    Args:
        price: Nightly rate
        bookings: Number of bookings per month
        operating_cost_rate: Operating costs as % of revenue (default 25%)
    
    Returns:
        Dictionary with financial metrics
    """
    # Calculate the metrics
    gross_revenue = price * bookings
    operating_costs = gross_revenue * operating_cost_rate
    net_profit = gross_revenue - operating_costs
    profit_margin = net_profit / gross_revenue if gross_revenue > 0 else 0
    
    # Return organized results
    return {
        "gross_revenue": gross_revenue,
        "operating_costs": operating_costs,
        "net_profit": net_profit,
        "profit_margin": profit_margin
    }

# Now use it for any property
luxury_metrics = calculate_property_metrics(price=350, bookings=15)
budget_metrics = calculate_property_metrics(price=85, bookings=25)

print("🏢 Luxury Property:")
print(f"  Revenue: ${luxury_metrics['gross_revenue']:,}")
print(f"  Profit: ${luxury_metrics['net_profit']:,}")
print(f"  Margin: {luxury_metrics['profit_margin']:.1%}")

print("\n🏠 Budget Property:")
print(f"  Revenue: ${budget_metrics['gross_revenue']:,}")
print(f"  Profit: ${budget_metrics['net_profit']:,}")
print(f"  Margin: {budget_metrics['profit_margin']:.1%}")
```

**🎯 Why Functions Matter:**
- **Eliminate repetition** - Write once, use many times
- **Reduce errors** - Logic is in one place
- **Easy to update** - Change formula once, affects everywhere
- **Professional code** - How real businesses organize code

**🔧 Function Parts:**
- **def** - Creates the function
- **Parameters** - Input values (price, bookings)
- **Default values** - `operating_cost_rate=0.25`
- **return** - What the function gives back
- **Docstring** - Explains what it does

### 4.2 Advanced Business Function

```python
def investment_decision_engine(price, monthly_rent, expenses, growth_rate, years):
    """
    Determine if a property is a good investment.
    
    Returns investment grade and key metrics.
    """
    # Calculate annual metrics
    annual_income = monthly_rent * 12
    annual_expenses = expenses * 12
    annual_cash_flow = annual_income - annual_expenses
    
    # Calculate returns
    cash_on_cash_return = annual_cash_flow / price
    
    # Project future value
    future_value = price * ((1 + growth_rate) ** years)
    total_cash_flow = annual_cash_flow * years
    total_return = (future_value - price + total_cash_flow) / price
    
    # Investment decision logic
    if cash_on_cash_return >= 0.12 and total_return >= 0.50:
        grade = "A+ EXCELLENT"
        recommendation = "STRONG BUY"
    elif cash_on_cash_return >= 0.08 and total_return >= 0.30:
        grade = "B+ GOOD"
        recommendation = "BUY"
    elif cash_on_cash_return >= 0.05:
        grade = "C ACCEPTABLE"
        recommendation = "CONSIDER"
    else:
        grade = "D POOR"
        recommendation = "AVOID"
    
    return {
        "grade": grade,
        "recommendation": recommendation,
        "cash_on_cash": cash_on_cash_return,
        "total_return": total_return,
        "annual_cash_flow": annual_cash_flow,
        "future_value": future_value
    }

# Test different investment scenarios
properties_to_analyze = [
    {"name": "Luxury Condo", "price": 800000, "rent": 4500, "expenses": 1200},
    {"name": "Starter Home", "price": 300000, "rent": 2200, "expenses": 800},
    {"name": "Fixer Upper", "price": 150000, "rent": 1500, "expenses": 600}
]

print("🏦 Investment Analysis Report:")
print("=" * 50)

for prop in properties_to_analyze:
    analysis = investment_decision_engine(
        price=prop["price"],
        monthly_rent=prop["rent"], 
        expenses=prop["expenses"],
        growth_rate=0.03,  # 3% annual appreciation
        years=10
    )
    
    print(f"\n🏠 {prop['name']}:")
    print(f"  Grade: {analysis['grade']}")
    print(f"  Recommendation: {analysis['recommendation']}")

    print(f"  10-Year Total Return: {analysis['total_return']:.1%}")
    print(f"  Annual Cash Flow: ${analysis['annual_cash_flow']:,}")
```

**🚀 Advanced Function Features:**
- **Multiple parameters** - Handle complex business scenarios
- **Complex calculations** - Multi-step financial analysis
- **Structured output** - Return organized results
- **Business logic** - Automated decision making

## Step 5: Object-Oriented Programming - Thinking in Business Objects

### 5.1 Your First Business Class

**💡 The Concept:** Instead of scattered variables, organize related data and functions together.

```python
class Property:
    """Represents a rental property with all its data and methods."""
    
    def __init__(self, name, price, bedrooms, neighborhood):
        """Initialize a new property."""
        self.name = name
        self.price = price
        self.bedrooms = bedrooms
        self.neighborhood = neighborhood
        self.bookings = 0
        self.reviews = []
    
    def add_booking(self, nights=1):
        """Record a new booking."""
        self.bookings += nights
        return f"Booked {nights} nights. Total: {self.bookings}"
    
    def add_review(self, rating, comment=""):
        """Add a customer review."""
        self.reviews.append({"rating": rating, "comment": comment})
        return f"Review added. Average rating: {self.get_average_rating():.1f}"
    
    def get_average_rating(self):
        """Calculate average review rating."""
        if not self.reviews:
            return 0
        return sum(review["rating"] for review in self.reviews) / len(self.reviews)
    
    def calculate_monthly_revenue(self):
        """Calculate projected monthly revenue."""
        return self.price * self.bookings
    
    def get_performance_summary(self):
        """Generate a performance report."""
        revenue = self.calculate_monthly_revenue()
        avg_rating = self.get_average_rating()
        
        return {
            "name": self.name,
            "monthly_revenue": revenue,
            "average_rating": avg_rating,
            "total_bookings": self.bookings,
            "review_count": len(self.reviews)
        }

# Create property objects
downtown_suite = Property("Downtown Luxury Suite", 250, 2, "Manhattan")
brooklyn_house = Property("Brooklyn Family House", 150, 3, "Brooklyn")

# Use the properties
print("🏠 Property Management System:")
print("=" * 40)

# Add some business activity
print(downtown_suite.add_booking(5))
print(downtown_suite.add_review(5, "Amazing location!"))
print(downtown_suite.add_review(4, "Beautiful property"))

print(brooklyn_house.add_booking(8))
print(brooklyn_house.add_review(5, "Perfect for families"))

# Generate reports
downtown_report = downtown_suite.get_performance_summary()
brooklyn_report = brooklyn_house.get_performance_summary()

print(f"\n📊 {downtown_report['name']}:")
print(f"  Monthly Revenue: ${downtown_report['monthly_revenue']:,}")
print(f"  Average Rating: {downtown_report['average_rating']:.1f}/5")
print(f"  Reviews: {downtown_report['review_count']}")

print(f"\n📊 {brooklyn_report['name']}:")
print(f"  Monthly Revenue: ${brooklyn_report['monthly_revenue']:,}")
print(f"  Average Rating: {brooklyn_report['average_rating']:.1f}/5")
print(f"  Reviews: {brooklyn_report['review_count']}")
```

**🎯 Why Classes Matter:**
- **Organization** - Related data and functions stay together
- **Reusability** - Create many properties from one template
- **Real-world modeling** - Code matches how you think about business
- **Scalability** - Easy to add new features

**🔧 Class Components:**
- **`__init__`** - Sets up new objects (like filling out a form)
- **Methods** - Functions that belong to the class
- **Attributes** - Data that belongs to each object
- **self** - Refers to the specific object being used

### 5.2 Advanced Business Class

```

**🚀 Advanced OOP Concepts:**
- **Composition** - Classes that contain other classes
- **Business intelligence** - Classes that analyze data
- **Complex methods** - Functions that do sophisticated calculations
- **List comprehensions** - Elegant data processing

## Step 6: Working with Real Data

### 6.1 Loading and Processing Business Data

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load real Airbnb data
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fenago/datasets/refs/heads/main/AirBnB_NYC_2019.csv"
airbnb_data = pd.read_csv(url)

print(f"📊 Loaded {len(airbnb_data):,} real properties")
print(f"Columns: {list(airbnb_data.columns)}")

# Apply what you learned - analyze with Python fundamentals
def analyze_neighborhood_performance(data, neighborhood):
    """Use your Python skills to analyze a neighborhood."""
    
    # Filter data (like an if statement for data)
    neighborhood_data = data[data['neighbourhood_group'] == neighborhood]
    
    if len(neighborhood_data) == 0:
        return f"No data found for {neighborhood}"
    
    # Calculate metrics (variables and calculations)
    avg_price = neighborhood_data['price'].mean()
    property_count = len(neighborhood_data)
    avg_reviews = neighborhood_data['number_of_reviews'].mean()
    
    # Business decision logic (if/else)
    if avg_price > 200:
        market_type = "LUXURY"
    elif avg_price > 100:
        market_type = "MID-RANGE"
    else:
        market_type = "BUDGET"
    
    # Organize results (dictionary)
    return {

# Use loops to analyze all neighborhoods
neighborhoods = airbnb_data['neighbourhood_group'].unique()
analysis_results = []

print("\n🗽 NYC Market Analysis:")

    def __init__(self, name, price, monthly_rent, expenses):
        # Initialize your property
        pass
    
    def calculate_roi(self):
        # Calculate return on investment
        pass
    
    def get_investment_grade(self):
        # Use if/else to assign investment grade
        pass

def analyze_market_opportunity(price, rent, location):
    """Function to evaluate market opportunity."""
    # Your market analysis logic
    pass

def find_best_investments(property_list, budget):
    """Use loops to find properties within budget."""
    # Your investment filtering logic
    pass

# Load real data and apply your system
# Use the Airbnb dataset or create your own property data
```
